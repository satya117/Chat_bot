<h2>What is a chatbot?</h2>
<p>A chatbot is artificial intelligence (AI) software that can imitate a natural language discussion (or chat) with a user via messaging apps, websites or mobile apps. </p>

<h3>What is the significance of chatbots? </h3>
<p>A chatbot is frequently described as one of the most advanced and promising forms of human-machine interaction. Chatbots can automatically simulate interactions with customers based on a set of predefined conditions or events.</p>

<p>From a technology standpoint, however, a chatbot is simply the next step in the evolution of a Question Answering system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP). One of the most common examples of Natural Language Processing is usage in many organizations' end-use applications in formulating responses to inquiries in natural language.</p>

<h2>Types of Chatbots</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Generative Based</b></li>
  <p>Retrieval based chatbots, employ techniques such as keyword matching, machine learning, and deep learning to find the most appropriate response. These chatbots, regardless of technology, solely deliver predefined responses and do not generate fresh output. From a database of predefined responses, the chatbot is trained to offer the best possible response. The responses are based on previously collected data.</p>
